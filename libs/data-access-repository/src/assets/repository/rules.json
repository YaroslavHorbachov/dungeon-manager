To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \"If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it,\" and \"If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\"</p>\r\n<p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p>\r\n<p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the <strong>web</strong> spell and ready <strong>magic missile</strong>, your <strong>web</strong> spell ends, and if you take damage before you release <strong>magic missile</strong> with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>",

The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable."

        "description": "Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury. \n\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. \n\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points."

For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p>\r\n<p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.</p>\r\n<p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>\r\n<p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.</p>\r\n<p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save.

The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Athletics\">Athletics</h5>\r\n<p>Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</li>\r\n<li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.</li>\r\n<li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5 id=\"OtherStrengthChecks\">Other Strength Checks</h5>\r\n<p>The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li>\r\n<li>Break free of bonds</li>\r\n<li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li>\r\n<li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li>\r\n<li>Tip over a statue</li>\r\n<li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id=\"AttackRollsandDamage\">Attack Rolls and Damage</h4>\r\n<p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"LiftingandCarrying\">Lifting and Carrying</h4>\r\n<p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Carrying Capacity.</strong> Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Push, Drag, or Lift.</strong> You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Size and Strength.</strong> Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"VariantEncumbrance\">Variant: Encumbrance</h4>\r\n<p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in <a title=\"Armor and Shields\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/equipment#ArmorandShields\">chapter 5</a>.</p>\r\n<p>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are <strong>encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.</p>\r\n<p>If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead <strong>heavily encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.</p>"

The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Acrobatics\">Acrobatics</h5>\r\n<p>Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"SleightofHand\">Sleight of Hand</h5>\r\n<p>Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Stealth\">Stealth</h5>\r\n<p>Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"OtherDexterityChecks\">Other Dexterity Checks</h5>\r\n<p>The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li>\r\n<li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li>\r\n<li>Pick a lock</li>\r\n<li>Disable a trap</li>\r\n<li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li>\r\n<li>Wriggle free of bonds</li>\r\n<li>Play a stringed instrument</li>\r\n<li>Craft a small or detailed object</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id=\"AttackRollsandDamage\">Attack Rolls and Damage</h4>\r\n<p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow.

Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat, as described in chapter 9, \"<a title=\"Initiative\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#Initiative\">Combat</a>.\"</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>HIDING</strong></p>\r\n<p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p>\r\n<p>You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p>\r\n<p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Passive Perception.</strong> When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What Can You See?</strong> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <strong>lightly</strong> or <strong>heavily obscured&nbsp;</strong>as explained in chapter 8, &ldquo;<a title=\"Vision and Light\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#VisionandLight\">Adventuring</a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>"

A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p>\r\n<p>The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Hold your breath</li>\r\n<li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>\r\n<li>Go without sleep</li>\r\n<li>Survive without food or water</li>\r\n<li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id=\"HitPoints\">Hit Points</h4>\r\n<p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points.

For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier.

For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</aside>\r\n<h5 id=\"Survival\">Survival</h5>\r\n<p>The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"OtherWisdomChecks\">Other Wisdom Checks</h5>\r\n<p>The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>\r\n<li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\">Spellcasting Ability</h4>\r\n<p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>"
